This project is developing a COVID-19 website that uses heirarchical clustering to map certain areas. This starts by taking data from NIH and CDC and merging the data together first. 
This data set was extremely large which did increase computational time. This still needs to be modified for optimization. After this happened, the data points were placed on a US map. 
Then hierarchical clustering algorhtims were applied using the top down approach. This showed the regions with the clusters. This data contained covid-19 deaths, cases, age groups, 
and dates.
